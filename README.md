# Library for DS3231 Real Time Clock

## Background
Developed using these modules  
https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-DS3231-Precision-Arduino-Raspberry/dp/B01N1LZSK3/  

Developed on Arduino but can be ported to other platforms by changing the I2C read/write code in readRegister() and writeRegister().
